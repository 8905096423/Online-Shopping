# Online-Shopping

I developed a comprehensive C program to simulate an online shopping system. The program includes features such as user account management, product search, cart management, and payment processing. It utilizes data structures like structs and arrays to organize user profiles, product information, and cart items. The system allows users to create accounts, log in securely, search for products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases using various payment methods. This project honed my skills in C programming, data structures, file handling, and software development methodologies.
